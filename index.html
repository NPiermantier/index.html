<p>In electronics, a vacuum tube, an electron tube, or just a tube,
is a device that controls electric current between electrodes in an evacuated container. Vacuum tubes mostly rely on thermionic emission 
of electrons from a hot filament or a cathode heated by the filament. This type is called a thermionic tube or thermionic valve. A phototube, 
however, achieves electron emission through the photoelectric effect. Not all electronic circuit valves/electron tubes are vacuum tubes
gas-filled tubes are similar devices containing a gas, typically at low pressure, which exploit phenomena related to electric discharge in gases, usually without a heater.
The simplest vacuum tube, the diode, contains only a heater, a heated electron-emitting cathode, and a plate. 
Current can only flow in one direction through the device between the two electrodes, as electrons emitted by the cathode travel through the tube and are collected by the anode. 
Adding one or more control grids within the tube allows the current between the cathode and anode to be controlled by the voltage on the grid or grids.
Tubes with grids can be used for many purposes, including amplification, rectification, switching, oscillation, and display.

<p> I think that this invention is very important to the history of computers because without them, all of the electronics from the first 
half of the twentieth century wouldn't have worked. Also, we never would have made the jump to capacitors later on in history.
