<div id=Phones><h1>The History of Cellular Phones</h1>

<p>

The Telephone (“Phone”) is a telecommunications device that allows 2+ users to conductlong distance conversations.

Telephones work through cell towers and satellites. The telephone was first introduced at the beggining of the industrial

revolution. Built upon the succesive improvements in the telegrapgh, the phone was based around the idea of quick, reliable nd affordable 

long distance conversations.

In 1876 a Scottish immigrant by the name of Alexander Graham Bell was granted a patent for the first telephone. Al

In the beginning of their history telephone lines were directly connected

to 2 different locations meaning you couldonly talk to that person you are connected to.

Later on all the telephone lines were connected to a central point.

But to talk to another person, lines would have to be physically connected.

The first mobile phone was introduced to the world in 1973 by Motorola.

These phones were quite like computers and were not directly connected to telephone lines.

Since the turn of the millennium personal wireless cellphones have taken over the world(Skynet).

These phones are nearly as powerful as a computer and can be put in your pocket.

People didn't start using the term "smartphone" until 1995, but the first true smartphone actually made its debut three years earlier in 1992.

It was called the Simon Personal Communicator, and it was created by IBM more than 15 years before Apple released the iPhone.

IBM's Simon was the first phone to meld together the functions of a cell phone and a PDA, and it launched with the price tag of $899 with a service contract ($1,435 in today's dollars), according to Byte Magazine.

The Simon was far ahead of its time, however. The smartphone featured a monochrome LCD touchscreen measuring 4.5 inches by 1.4 inches, and it came with a stylus.


Aside from its calling capabilities, you could also use the Simon to send and receive emails, faxes, and pages. There were also a suite of built-in features including a notes collection you could write in, an address book that looked like file folder, calendar, world clock, and a way to schedule appointments.

In the modern world we live in nearly everyone in North America owns a cell phone.

Numerable companies such as Apple and Samsung run the smartphone world and rip everyone off.

In fact, over a billion Apple products are currently in use and I can see exactly why.

Portable phones although sometimes overwhelming and extremely expensive are extremely useful.

They can be used to check up on numerous things such as the weather and can be used to access many sites such as snapchat.</p> 

The only major problem besides the odd phone blowing up is that children can be exposed to inappropriate sites.

Although this is a problem smartphones and cellphones have benefited the world greatly and will be continued to be used by all.
